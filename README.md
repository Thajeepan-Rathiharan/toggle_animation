# Animated Sharingan Toggle Button

A small project I started a few days ago and gave up on because I couldn't get the JavaScript right, but after watching a YouTube tutorial and following the script they wrote, I was able to make this project happen.

It's a button animation, where when you click it, the background image and button icon changes. There is also audio, but you will have to click on the button to unmute it (and mute it again if you don't like the sound)to hear the audio that plays when you click on the button in the middle of the page for the animation to take place with the audio. The button can be toggled forwards and backwards, where the background image of the website will also change back and forth. 

This can be viewed on mobile devices too as well as desktop devices with no issues.
